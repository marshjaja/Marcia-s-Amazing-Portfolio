 <h1>DESCRIPTION 📖</h1>

# 👩🏾‍💻🏳️‍🌈Marcia Mijnhijmer🏳️‍🌈👩🏾‍💻 builds their Portfolio website
##  Criterea
- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others - ON MOBILE AS WELL
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

 ## This is not my best work an i will continue to work on it during the course
